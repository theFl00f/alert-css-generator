## Welcome! 
Welcome to a visual development tool for alerts/modals.
## How to use this app
1. Clone repo.
1. Install dependencies with ```npm install``` and ```npm update```
1. To run, use command ```npm run start-dev```

## A History...
I created this because I love the idea of custom alerts, but when it comes to adding alert styling at the end of a project, I tend to end up trimming this plan off the deliverable, due to time restrictions and it just taking a bit too long. So, I decided to make this app to allow customization visually and quickly, while allowing you to add items to the database!
## What stack is this?
This is MEJN, using jQuery. Styling for forms, layout and typography with Bootstrap.
## Current Features
* Modify alert box, alert message (optional) and button content/styles
* Current style options include:
    - background-color
    - color
    - font-family (4 presets and unset)
    - border-width
    - border-color
    - border-radius
    - dimensions (responsive)
    - spacing
* Custom class names
* Output formatted HTML and CSS
* Save your design to the database, titled or anonymous
* See all user alerts that have been saved!
* Steal others designs, the HTML and CSS are saved too! 👀
* Generate colour palettes in either analogous, monochromatic, split compliment or triadic combinations! (uses tinycolor)
* Modify this palette to your liking on the Palette menu
* Once you switch to styling your alert, simply click and drag from the palette at the top to check out your palette in action. (uses jQuery UI)
