## How to use this app

## A History...
I created this because I love the idea of custom alerts, but when it comes to adding alert styling at the end of a project, I tend to end up trimming this plan off the deliverable, due to time restrictions and it just taking a bit too long. So, I decided to make this app to allow customization visually and quickly, while allowing you to add items to the database!
